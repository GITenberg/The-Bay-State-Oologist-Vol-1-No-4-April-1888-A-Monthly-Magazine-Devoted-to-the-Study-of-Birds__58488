<h2 id="Notes_on_Some_Birds_of_Texas">Notes on Some Birds of Texas.</h2>

<p class="center">BY J. A. SINGLEY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="center smaller">(<i>continued from page 11.</i>)</p>

<h3><b>No. 36.</b> <i>Lophophanes bicolor (Linn.).</i> <b>Tufted Titmouse.</b></h3>

<p>They are not very particular about a nesting place—provided it’s a hollow—and
will indifferently occupy a natural cavity in a tree, an old woodpecker’s nest
or a martin box. The nest is composed of dead leaves and moss and very often
cast-off snake-skin, invariably lined with some sort of animals’ hair.</p>

<p>The bird will not leave the nest after incubation commences, but will sit close
while the entrance to the nest is being enlarged, and when a hand is inserted in
the cavity will puff itself up, make a hissing noise and peck at the intruder.
It has to be lifted off the nest before the eggs can be taken, thus making identification
positive.</p>

<p>The number of eggs in a set varies from four to eight, usually six or seven, and
varying from a blunt oval to elongated, almost equal-ended: white, spotted with
reddish-brown, thickest at the larger end, where are also found some obscure lilac
shell markings. Sometimes the brown is very pale and the spots few and small.
Eggs like this resemble those of the Plain Titmouse. A series of fifteen eggs
average .75×.36 inches. Two or more broods are raised, fresh eggs being found
from the 1st of April to the last of May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3><b>No. 42.</b> <i>Parus carolinensis (Aud.,)</i> <b>Carolina Chickadee</b>.</h3>

<p>Like the last, this is called “Tomtit” by the natives. It shares most of the
habits of the Titmouse but I don’t think it is a nest robber.</p>

<p>This species is very like the Black-capped Chickadee of the Eastern States, replacing
that species in the South Atlantic and Gulf States. The chin, throat and
top of head to nape, black, sides of head, whitish; rest of upper parts brownish-ash;
under parts dingy white and slightly brownish on the sides. Wings and
tail like the upper parts. A specimen before me measures—length, 4.53 in.; extent,
7.02 in.; wing, 2.46; tail, 2.24. It is very close to P. atricapillus and should really
be listed as a variety of that species.</p>

<p>This Chickadee is resident here, and is found chiefly in the timbered uplands,
where its merry “Chick-a-dee-dee” is heard all the year round.</p>

<p>It commences nesting in March, and fresh eggs can be found until June (thus
indicating that two or three broods are raised in a season.) It is a little more
choice in its location for a nest than the Titmouse. A deserted Woodpecker’s
nest is often used, but the majority of the nests I find are in rotten black-jack
stubs and excavated by the birds themselves. A few of them nest in boxes that
I’ve nailed up in the woods. The nests vary but little being built of moss, cotton
(when obtainable) a few feathers and generally lined with rabbit fur, sometimes
with the hair or fur of other animals. The bird sets close when the nest is disturbed
and it is necessary to lift it off to see what it is trying to conceal.</p>

<p>The eggs vary in number from five to seven, never more with me; oval in
shape, white, thickly spotted with reddish-brown. The spots are sometimes confluent,
forming blotches, occasionally covering the larger end of the egg. Sometimes
the eggs are finely speckled with small pale-brown spots, and one specimen
before me has these specks forming a wreath about the smaller end. A series of
eleven eggs (two sets,) average .63×.52 inches. I have also found several sets
where the eggs were sub-globular, like those of some owls.</p>

<h2 id="The_Nashville_Warbler">The Nashville Warbler.</h2>

<p class="center">BY WM. L. KELLS, LISTOWEL, ONTARIO, CANADA.</p>

<p>The life-history of this bird is yet, to a great extent, wrapped in obscurity.
Sometimes it is numerous in the Spring migration; again it is comparatively rare.
It can only yet be regarded as a migrant in the south and central parts of Ontario,
as no certain record has yet been made of its nesting, or making its summer home
in this locality; though it is very probable that more of this genus of birds may
remain during the summer, and nest in the deep, swampy woods of this Province,
than is now generally known.</p>

<p>In my early days, while rambling in the forest, or at work in the woods in the
summer time, I have seen nests of little birds, never since discovered by
me, and almost every year since I began to form my Oological collection, I
have taken one or more nests of Warblers previously unknown to me, and as I occasionally
catch glimpses of others in my hunting excursions in the summer season,
I am led to believe, that as time progresses and more attention is given to the
subject, more nests of these birds will be discovered and described by our rising
Ornithologists, and among others that of the Nashville Warbler. This is the
more probable in the case of this species, from the fact that its general habitat is
in deep, swampy places, where few persons interested in Ornithology care to penetrate,
and also from the fact that specimens of this species are occasionally observed
on the margins of swampy woods, in the summer season.</p>

<p>It is said that this species nests upon the ground in the moss that grows in damp
places, and to form the same with dry leaves, fibres of bark, pine needles, fine, dry
grass and hay. The eggs, four or five, are white, speckled with lilac or reddish-brown.</p>

<p>This is one of those wanderers of the Mississippi Valley which appear to enter
Ontario from the south-west. It is between four or five inches in length, and on
the upper parts the plumage is of an olive-green, brighter on the rump; but ashy
on the head. Below it is bright yellow, paler towards the lower parts, with olive
shading on the sides. Crown with a chestnut patch, and pale ring round the
eyes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="Instructions_for_Collecting_and_Preserving_Birds_and_Eggs">Instructions for Collecting and Preserving Birds and Eggs.</h2>

<p class="center">BY PROF. J. A. SINGLEY, GIDDINGS, TEXAS.</p>

<p class="center smaller">(<i>continued from page 21.</i>)</p>

<p>Each of the three eggs should be marked No. 10. By this method, the first number
always representing the number of the set, the second the number of the
species and the third the number of eggs in the set, mistakes are almost impossible.
If he saw the bird he should write “seen” after the last item. If the bird was
caught or shot, he can mention it instead of “seen.” The last two items explain
themselves, and all these items except the first, must enter into the data of the set.
It is not necessary to give materials of nest, except in the case of rare species. I
follow the above method of authenticating, to save time; but the collector who
has plenty of that commodity to spare, can of course write out full particulars of
each set in the field. Never trust to memory in these matters, have it in black
and white.</p>

<p>The collector, having returned home and being ready to prepare his eggs, let
him take them out of his box where he has placed them well wrapped in cotton,
as taken, and unwrapping them, place each set by itself on the “dryer” described
elsewhere (he will now begin to appreciate that useful article,) now getting his
tools, not forgetting a glass of water to use in rinsing the eggs, he is ready to go
to work.</p>

<p>The points of the drills, as bought, are always dull, and it is recommended to
start the hole in the egg with a pin or needle. These useful articles are small,
likely to get lost while working with, and make one more article to look after.
You can dispense with them by carefully filing the point of your drill to a needle-like
point. Select the least showy part of the egg, and holding it (the egg) in
your left hand (the right if you are left-handed) put the point of the drill against
this “least showy part,” and twirl it (the drill) between the thumb and forefinger.
Don’t bear on the drill, as if you were drilling in iron, if you do you’ll have a hole
clear through both sides of the egg, something you don’t want. The hole, being
drilled until the largest circumference of the burr passes inside of the egg, don’t
try to pull it out, as a broken egg will be the result if you do. There is an internal
pellicle lining the egg: if this is not cut out where the hole is drilled, it will
interfere with blowing the egg. By bringing the burr of the drill up against this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
pellicle, as if you were going to remove it from the egg, and giving the same
twirling motion that you did when drilling, the pellicle will be cut all around the
edges of the hole, and the drill will come out. Now take your blow-pipe, and putting
the point of it close to the hole, blow gently and the contents will come out.
When incubation is more or less advanced, a larger hole must be drilled, and the
embryo removed with the hook and scissors, a tedious operation and not always
successful even with the greatest of care. Better let incubated eggs remain in the
nest. A little experience will teach you how to differentiate fresh eggs from those
that are too far advanced to save.</p>

<p>Never put the point of the blow-pipe inside of the egg, as a bursted egg will be
the result, especially so, if your lungs are well developed. Having emptied the
egg of its contents, the next step is to take a mouthful of water and inject it
through the blow-pipe into the egg, rinsing it thoroughly. Large eggs should be
filled half full of water and well shaken. Eggs treated in this manner are perfectly
clean inside and offer no inducements to insects to harbor within, a thing
that they will surely do in eggs prepared in a slovenly manner. Having blown
all the water out of the egg, take a soft cloth and wipe it dry, removing any foreign
matter that may be adhering to it, taking care, however, not to rub
off the number you put on it when collected, and also notice that you
do not rub off any of the markings on it. On some eggs the pigment is
only loosely applied on the outside. Now place the egg, hole downwards, directly
over one of the holes on your dryer, and it will drain and dry in a few hours; continue
in this way until you clean all your eggs, keeping each set to itself and adding
another memorandum in your note-book opposite each set, as to the state of
incubation of that set. When the eggs are dry, fill out a data for each set. These
particulars are taken from your note-book. Suppose he (the collector) takes the
first set, that of the Red-headed Woodpecker. He will fill out a blank as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No. 375. Name, Red-headed Woodpecker.</p>

<p>Collector, John Smith.</p>

<p>Locality, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Date, June 3d, 1887.</p>

<p>Set mark, 1/4.</p>

<p>Number of eggs in set, 4. Identity, bird seen.</p>

<p>Nest, excavated in an elm tree, 20 feet up; eggs laid on chips on bottom of cavity.</p></div>

<p>The collector will of course substitute his own name, locality and date, for those
given above, and if this should prove to be the second, third or fourth set of that
species taken during the season, he would mark the set as 2-4, 3-4, 4-4 and so on.</p>

<p>So few exchange notices were received in time to be published in this issue that
we have decided to hold them for the next.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Persons receiving sample copies of this issue, will oblige us greatly by acknowledging
the receipt of same. We received so many replies from those complying
with the above request, last month, that we thought it best to try it again. If
you cannot subscribe, we like to know that you received the copy sent you, and
what you think of our magazine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The May “Hoosier Naturalist” published by R. B. Trouslot &amp; Co., Valparaiso,
Ind., will contain much matter of interest to all Ornithologists and Oologists. A
sample copy will be mailed free to all applying to the publishers. We can furnish
you with a year’s subscription each to the “Hoosier Naturalist” and the “B. S. O.”
for 50 cents, the regular price of the latter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The April number of the “Hawkeye Ornithologist and Oologist” reached us just
before going to press. We are sorry to see that the editors as well as Mr. Oliver
Davie are laboring under a wrong impression. In the February issue when we published
that notice regarding “Davies’ Key,” we meant exactly what we said, as Mr.
Davie, in a letter dated Jan. 26, ’88, said: “I can furnish you copies of my Key in
quantities at —— per copy.” This notice was inserted simply to allay a wrong
impression, which would likely arise after reading the notice in the Jan “H. O.
&amp; O.,” and not as a “hit.” As regards not having purchased any copies of Mr.
Davie, we would say we had a number of copies on hand we wished to dispose of,
and we were greatly surprised to see Mr. Davies’ letter, after having written him
explaining the reasons of our not ordering copies from him.</p>

<h2 id="The_Pileated_Woodpecker">The Pileated Woodpecker.</h2>

<p class="center">BY J. W. JACOBS, WAYNESBURG, PA.</p>

<p>On April 24th, I was passing through a large patch of woods, taking note of all
the bird life I could see, when I noticed a large hole near the top of a “snag.” I
went a little closer, and then I saw that the hole was too large for a Red-head
(M. erythrocephalus) or a Flicker (C. auratus).</p>

<p>I went up to the tree; there was a great pile of chips on the ground; I hammered
on the tree, and a Pileated Woodpecker (Hylotomus pileatus) flew out, I
climbed up, but owing to the tree being high, smooth bark and no limbs at all, I
could not stick, so I resolved to call again, better prepared for an attack on the
tree.</p>

<p>On the 28th, I started out to procure the set of eggs, if there proved to be any
in the nest. Everything went well until I reached the tree, and there I could see
that the hand of destruction had visited H. pileatus, for the tree was stretched out
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Two wood-choppers had been in the woods the day before, making rails; they
saw the old bird fly from her nest, and of course, through curiosity, they cut the
tree down to see what the eggs looked like. I found the pieces of three or four
egg-shells, and probably there were more. I did not find out how many they
broke.</p>

<p>The hole was thirty-five feet from the ground, and such a fall as that would have
broken a thousand eggs, had that number been in the cavity.</p>

<p>About two months later, I was in the vicinity of this tree, and saw in a neighboring
tree a large hole resembling the first. I did not climb to the hole, for from
all appearance, the brood had hatched and were gone. I think this hole was excavated
by the same pair of birds.</p>

<p>On May 21st, I was collecting in a large strip of woods, about a quarter of a
mile from town, when I saw in a live maple an excavation of H. pileatus. I
climbed up and found the nest contained four young birds and one nearly fresh
egg. This is a beautiful egg, glossy white, and measures 1.25×.95 inches.</p>

<p>During the time I was in the tree, both old birds were perched not far off, and
every now and then would utter their harsh cackle.</p>

<p>Later in the season I found another nest of this bird; it was in a live maple,
twenty feet from the ground. The young birds had flown.</p>

<h2 id="A_Days_Collecting">A Day’s Collecting.</h2>

<p class="center">BY H. C. COOK, POTSDAM, N. Y.</p>

<p>On the 23d of May, last season, my chum and myself started out for a good solid
day’s work in the field. We took our climbing irons, egg-boxes and a big lunch,
for it has been our experience that it makes a fellow awful hungry to walk eight or
ten miles and shin up as many trees before dinner.</p>

<p>About a mile from the village we came to a small grove of high timber. Just
before we reached it, a crow flew out to meet us, circled over our heads and returned
again, a sure sign of a nest. We had, however, considerable difficulty in
finding it, as it was remarkably well concealed for so large a nest, in a beech about
thirty-five feet from the ground. It contained five highly incubated eggs of nearly
uniform size, but differing considerably in the ground color and markings. The
average measurement was 1.60×1.12. Three of the eggs were dark green, marked
with darker blotches, and the other two a much lighter green in ground color
with the same colored blotches.</p>

<p>After leaving this grove, we passed through several orchards without finding
anything until we came to the last one, where my chum spied a nest in a low apple
tree. Approaching it carefully, we obtained a good view of the bird, which I at
once knew to be a Black-billed Cuckoo (Coccygus erythrophthalmus.) The nest
contained three dull green eggs, very peculiar in regard to size, as one was small,
the next larger and the last measured nearly twice the size of the first. One was
fresh and the other two in different stages of incubation.</p>

<p>We stopped here to blow our eggs and eat our dinner, as it was about noon.
After we had accomplished this last most important duty, we continued our search
looking here and there, but seeing no desirable nest, until it began to get rather
discouraging, when, while hunting for the nests of the White-rumped Shrike
(Lanius ludovicianus excubitorides) in a large field of thorn apple trees, skirted
by a swampy woods, I made the great find of the day. I was passing by an old
dead stump, when, from between the roots and almost under my feet, a brownish
colored bird started up and flew away, making a peculiar whistling noise as it
went. Looking down, I saw a fine set of four eggs of the American Woodcock
(Philohela minor.) They were of unusual size, the largest measuring 1.85×1.10 in.</p>

<p>This ended our day’s collecting, and we went home well satisfied with the fruits
of our labor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center larger">HERE IS YOUR CHANCE</p>

<p>To enlarge your collection without cash. In order to increase the circulation of our

  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
